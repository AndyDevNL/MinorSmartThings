This project was made during the Minor Smart Things.
During the first semester of the Minor, each student had to create a weatherstation.
All the data from the diferent stations needed to be shown on a map with the diferent types of sensor data and geodata.


I took it upon myself to create this map and later Guus Ekkelenkam helped me with the pop up screens when pressing the pins on the map.
